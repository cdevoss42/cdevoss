    <p class="poem">in twilight i dreamed I had found the spark of me, the lesser of you, the greater of my grandpapa, and the line of love between men.</p>

    <p class="poem">        in daytime I saw the truth of what i was trying to do, the brighter side of you, the greater of my reflection day self, and the line of lies between men.</p>
        
    <p class="poem">   at dusk, I envisoned the dark side of my desires, the greater love of my true friends, and the stack of support I got when I really did not deserve it.</p>
        
        <p class="poem">at bedtime, I realized I had not the need to be trying so hard., the loads of egos i encountered, and the pile of untrue friends. i thought were true. they only used me.. as I used myself to prop myself on the piano, and pretend to play, or jump in the middle of the dance floor. only to slip and bust my lip…</p>
        
        <p class="poem">at death………………………. who knows… I am not dead.</p>
        
        <p class="poem">so in life, I dream of friends that are true, of days that are bright, of nights where the demons of the past stay at bay. I leave my ears open, I capture my heart before it closes between the soul. My eyes are still open, my touch for love reaches, my pain in my eyes are real.</p>
        
        <p class="poem">never let one day go, without a closure of happy, or a locked up of pain. life……………… does not give away the minutes… you take them up with worry……. stop.
