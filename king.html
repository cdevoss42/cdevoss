    <p class="poem">so if about the only thing that can destroy this king of nature is a huge crack of lighting, and this tree has been standing tall, and strong way before me, and will be here standing tall after me. after my “short” life. then today, to make my stand, I think I will BE the.. lighting. This is how powerful I want to be today. Lighting. The power of you, is in all of us. Only one you. The choice to use that power is only in you. YOU are all the power you need. No one owns it but you. Silence that negative voice holding you back from releasing your power. now. Be the lighting, today.   </p>
