    <br>
    <p class="poem">Fireflies fly into darkened spaces friends and lovers lay down their southern graces Attic Doors give solice to those weathering the storm.Bubbly Spirits & Nurtured Grapes new handshakes with strangers seem old. fireflies know when the stories are told. through songs of love, songs of sorrow. Stories need to be torched a glow with gold periods ,silver footnotes of folkâ€™s single lives.  Fireflies carry that light.From you to  I, from your grasp and capture to open hearts stored in glory.. </p>
